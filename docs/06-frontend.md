# 06 — Frontend Architecture

## Tech Stack

Frontend dependencies follow a **latest-stable** policy: pin every package to the most recent stable major published on npm at the time of `npm install`. Verify with `npm view <pkg> version` before adding or upgrading; if a newer major has shipped since the last check, prefer it unless a specific incompatibility is documented in the same change. The table below names the role each library plays — the version column captures the latest-stable snapshot at the time the row was last touched, not a pin.

| Technology | Version snapshot | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| React + ReactDOM | latest stable (19.x at 2026-05-06) | UI framework |
| Vite + @vitejs/plugin-react | latest stable (8.x at 2026-05-06) | Build tool and dev server |
| TypeScript | latest stable (6.x at 2026-05-06) | Type safety (`strict: true`) |
| Ant Design | latest stable (6.x at 2026-05-06) | UI component library |
| CodeMirror + @codemirror/lang-sql | latest stable (6.x at 2026-05-06) | SQL editor engine |
| Zustand | latest stable (5.x at 2026-05-06) | Global state management |
| TanStack Query | latest stable (5.x at 2026-05-06) | Server state, caching, refetching |
| Axios | latest stable (1.x at 2026-05-06) | HTTP client |
| React Router | latest stable (7.x at 2026-05-06, library mode) | Client-side routing |
| sql-formatter | latest stable (15.x at 2026-05-06) | SQL formatting (Ctrl+Shift+F) |
| Vitest + @testing-library/react | latest stable | Unit/component tests |
| Playwright | latest stable | E2E tests |

When upgrading the codebase to a new major, update this snapshot column in the same change so the doc stays in sync.

## Key Pages

### QueryEditorPage

The primary user-facing page. Features:

- **Datasource selector** — dropdown of datasources the user has access to, loads schema tree on selection
- **CodeMirror SQL editor** — see SQL Editor section below
- **AI Hint Panel** — displays AI analysis after the user clicks the **Analyze** button; the result is cleared as soon as the SQL is edited so the user must re-analyze before submitting.
- **Analyze button** — explicit user action that calls `POST /queries/analyze`. Rendered only when the selected datasource has `ai_analysis_enabled=true` and a non-null `ai_config_id`.
- **Justification field** — required text area for the reason behind the query
- **Submit button** — sends `POST /queries`, transitions to status tracking view. When the datasource has AI configured, Submit is disabled until a fresh AI analysis exists for the current SQL.
- **Status tracker** — real-time status updates via WebSocket (`PENDING_AI` → `PENDING_REVIEW` → `APPROVED` → `EXECUTED`)

### ReviewQueuePage

Available to users with `REVIEWER` or `ADMIN` role:

- Paginated list of queries in `PENDING_REVIEW` status assigned to this reviewer
- Each card shows: datasource name, submitter, query type, AI risk badge, time elapsed, SQL preview
- Quick approve/reject inline on card; full detail opens in a right-side drawer
- `ApprovalTimeline` shows which reviewers in the plan have already decided

### QueryDetailPage

Full detail view for any query:

- SQL text in read-only CodeMirror block with syntax highlighting
- `AiAnalysisAccordion` — expandable section showing risk score, all issues with suggestions
- `ApprovalTimeline` — visual timeline of review stages and decisions with reviewer comments
- Execution result section (if executed): rows affected, duration, timestamp. `QueryResultsTable` reads `column.restricted` from each `QueryResultColumn` returned by `GET /queries/{id}/results`; restricted columns render a lock icon + tooltip in the header and muted styling on cells (the value is already `"***"` from the backend — the frontend never has the raw value).
- Cancel button (if query is in `PENDING_*` status and viewer is the submitter)
- When `status === 'TIMED_OUT'`, a warning callout above the SQL block names the review plan, the configured `approval_timeout_hours`, and how long ago the timeout fired. The metadata sidebar surfaces `plan` / `timeout.hours` for any query whose datasource has a review plan, regardless of status. Status-pill colour and label come from `statusColors.ts` (`TIMED_OUT` → warn-amber palette, label "TIMED OUT").

### DatasourceCreateWizardPage *(ADMIN)*

Four-step flow at `/datasources/new` for adding a new datasource. Replaces a flat form so the user picks a database type first — and so the backend's on-demand JDBC driver loader (see `docs/05-backend.md` → Dynamic JDBC Driver Loading) can resolve the right driver before any connection is attempted.

1. **Type selection** — fetches `GET /datasources/types` and renders a grid of cards via `DatasourceTypeSelector`. Each card shows the logo (`icon_url`), display name, a one-line description, and a `DriverStatusBadge` (`READY` / `AVAILABLE` / `UNAVAILABLE`). Cards with `UNAVAILABLE` are disabled with a tooltip pointing the admin at the driver-cache configuration. Selecting a card advances to step 2 and seeds the form with `default_port` and `default_ssl_mode`.
2. **Connection details** — standard fields (name, host, port, database, username, password, ssl_mode), pre-filled from the type's defaults. A `JdbcUrlPreview` renders the URL live from `jdbc_url_template` as the user types. Bean-Validation errors surface inline. On first submit the wizard `POST`s `/datasources`; if the user returns to this step from **Test** and resubmits, the wizard `PUT`s the previously created record instead of issuing a second `POST` (which would 409 on the unique-name-per-org constraint). The primary button label switches from **Save and test** to **Save and continue** once a record exists.
3. **Test connection** — calls `POST /datasources/{id}/test` against the persisted datasource and surfaces latency or vendor error. **Back** returns to the connection step (record retained, resubmit becomes a `PUT`). **Next** advances to step 4 and is enabled only after a successful test; **Skip** lets admins proceed without a green test (e.g. air-gapped configuration). The first connection of a never-yet-resolved type may take 1–5 s due to driver download — show an explicit "Resolving driver…" state on the test button.
4. **Configuration** — review policy and limits before finishing: `connection_pool_size` (1–200), `max_rows_per_query` (1–1,000,000), `review_plan_id` (Select populated from `GET /review-plans`), `require_review_reads` / `require_review_writes` switches, plus the AI analysis toggle and AI config selector (from `GET /ai-configs`). Submit issues `PUT /datasources/{id}` and navigates to `DatasourceSettingsPage` with a success toast.

The wizard is the only entry point that materializes a datasource; `DatasourceListPage` links to it via a "New datasource" button.

**Custom drivers + dynamic mode.** The type-selection step groups results into two sections: a
**Bundled drivers** group (the five canonical engines) and a **Custom drivers** group (entries
where `source==="uploaded"` in `GET /datasources/types`). Each uploaded entry shows vendor +
driver class instead of the generic description. Selecting an uploaded entry passes the option
into the connection step, which:

- Sets `custom_driver_id` from `option.custom_driver_id` on submit so the backend resolves the
  per-driver classloader instead of the bundled registry.
- If the entry's `code` is `CUSTOM`, switches the connection form into **dynamic mode**: the
  host / port / database fields are replaced with a single `JDBC URL` textarea bound to
  `jdbc_url_override`. `JdbcUrlPreview` is suppressed (the URL is the URL).

When no uploaded drivers exist, the Custom drivers group renders a single help row with a deep
link to `/admin/drivers` so admins can upload one without abandoning the wizard. The selector
exposes a stable `optionKey(option)` helper so two uploaded drivers with the same target
`db_type` stay independently selectable.

### CustomDriversPage *(ADMIN — `/admin/drivers`)*

Lazy-loaded admin page listing the organization's uploaded JDBC drivers. Implemented in
`src/pages/admin/drivers/CustomDriversPage.tsx` with the upload flow in
`CustomDriverUploadModal.tsx`. Data source: `GET /datasources/drivers` via TanStack Query (key
`customDriverKeys.lists()`).

The table shows vendor, target `db_type`, fully-qualified driver class, JAR filename and size,
truncated SHA-256 (with copy button), uploader, and upload timestamp. The row action is a
single delete button gated by a `Popconfirm`; 409 `CUSTOM_DRIVER_IN_USE` errors surface via
`customDriverErrorMessage` with a count of referencing datasources.

The upload modal collects the JAR through Ant Design's `Upload.Dragger` (`.jar` extension and
50 MB size enforced client-side as a first line of defence), plus vendor name, target
`db_type` (including a "Custom / Dynamic JDBC" option), fully-qualified driver class, and the
admin-computed SHA-256. Form-level Bean-Validation mirrors the backend regexes:
`^[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*(\.[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*)+$` for the driver class and
`^[a-fA-F0-9]{64}$` for the SHA-256. On success the modal invalidates both
`customDriverKeys.lists()` and `['datasources', 'types']` so the wizard picks up the new entry
immediately.

**Logo asset licensing.** All five database type icons (`postgresql.svg`, `mysql.svg`, `mariadb.svg`, `oracle.svg`, `mssql.svg`) are sourced verbatim from [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/) pinned to release [v2.17.0](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/releases/tag/v2.17.0) and redistributed under the MIT licence. The licence text and attribution preamble live in `frontend/public/db-icons/LICENSE` — keep them next to the SVGs and update the preamble when the pinned tag is bumped. `generic.svg` is original AccessFlow artwork and remains as the fallback for any future `DbType` added before its icon has been vendored.

### DatasourceSettingsPage *(ADMIN)*

- Connection config form with live test button (`POST /datasources/{id}/test`)
- Schema explorer with table/column tree
- `PermissionMatrix` — table of all users × (can_read, can_write, can_ddl, row_limit, allowed_schemas, restricted columns count, expires_at). Restricted columns render as `"N columns"` with a hover tooltip listing the fully-qualified names; `"—"` when none.
- `GrantAccessModal` includes a `restricted_columns` multi-select populated from the datasource's introspected schema (`flattenSchemaToColumns` in `src/utils/schemaColumns.ts`). Help text explains that values are masked in results and the AI reviewer is informed but does not auto-reject.
- Review plan assignment and row limit configuration

### AuditLogPage *(ADMIN)*

- Searchable, filterable table of all audit events
- Filters: date range picker, user selector, action type multi-select
- Row click opens `AuditDetailDrawer` with full metadata JSON

### SetupProgressWidget (`components/common/SetupProgressWidget.tsx`)

A collapsible banner mounted in `AppLayout` directly above the route `<Outlet />`. It self-gates: returns `null` unless the current user is an `ADMIN` and every step is either configured server-side or skipped client-side. Non-admins and tenants that have finished onboarding never see it. Data comes from `GET /api/v1/admin/setup-progress` via TanStack Query (key `['setupProgress','current']`, `staleTime: 30s`).

The widget shows three numbered rows in this order:

1. **Create a review plan** → `/admin/review-plans`
2. **Add your first datasource** → `/datasources/new`
3. **Configure the AI provider** → `/admin/ai-configs/new`

Review plan is first because every datasource references a plan; AI is last because it is the most likely step to be skipped on a fresh install. Each pending step renders a primary "Set up" button plus a quieter "Skip" affordance — admins who don't want to configure that step (e.g. running without AI) can mark it skipped and see it stop nagging. Skipped steps render a "Skipped" tag with an "Undo skip" link so the decision is reversible. The progress bar counts skipped + configured equally; once all three are accounted for, the widget hides entirely.

State lives in `preferencesStore`:

- `setupProgressCollapsed` — collapse/expand state of the checklist body.
- `setupProgressSkipped: SetupStepId[]` — the IDs the admin marked skipped. Persisted to `localStorage` via Zustand `persist`, so the choice survives reloads but is intentionally per-browser (not per-org) since skipping is a UX nudge, not a policy.

The relevant mutations (create datasource, create review plan, save AI config) invalidate `setupProgressKeys.current()` on success so the widget reacts immediately when an admin completes a step the real way.

### Topbar (`components/common/Topbar.tsx`)

The app shell topbar contains: a mobile-nav menu button, a light/dark theme toggle, the
[language switcher](#language-switcher), the notification bell, and a sign-out button. It
deliberately has no global search input.

### Language switcher

`components/common/LanguageSwitcher.tsx` is a dropdown next to the theme toggle. It calls `GET /me/localization` (TanStack Query, key `['localization', 'me']`) to discover the org-admin's allow-list, and its menu lists only those languages by display name. On select it optimistically updates `preferencesStore.language` (which is what i18next, dayjs, and the Ant Design `ConfigProvider locale` all subscribe to in `main.tsx`) and fires `PUT /me/localization` to persist the choice on the server. On 4xx the mutation surfaces a toast via `errors.languages_save_error` but does not roll back the optimistic update — i18next has already switched and rolling back would be jarring; the user can re-select.

The seven supported locales (`en`, `es`, `de`, `fr`, `zh-CN`, `ru`, `hy`) are bundled at build time in `src/locales/*.json`. Adding a new language is a single new JSON file plus an entry in `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`/`LANGUAGE_DISPLAY_NAMES` in `src/i18n.ts`. Translations missing from a non-English locale fall back to English at runtime via i18next's `fallbackLng`.

`/admin/languages` is the admin counterpart: `LanguagesConfigPage` renders three controls — multi-select for `available_languages`, single-select for `default_language` (filtered to that allow-list), single-select for `ai_review_language` (full seven-language list, independent of user choice). On save it `PUT`s `/admin/localization-config` and invalidates both `['localization', 'admin']` and `['localization', 'me']` so the topbar switcher picks up the new allow-list immediately.

`NotificationBell` (in the same folder) wraps an Ant Design `<Badge>` + `<Dropdown>`
around the bell icon. It uses TanStack Query for the unread count
(`['notifications','unread-count']`, polled every 60 s) and lazy-loads the inbox list
(`['notifications','list',{page,size}]`) when the dropdown opens. Mutations for mark-read,
mark-all-read, and delete invalidate both keys on success. Clicking a row navigates to
`/queries/{query_id}` when the payload has one and marks the row read in the same handler.
The `notification.created` WebSocket event triggers default invalidations (see the WS
default-invalidations table) so the badge and list update in near-real-time without
polling.

## SQL Editor Component

Built on **CodeMirror 6** (`@codemirror/lang-sql`).

### Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| SQL syntax highlighting | `@codemirror/lang-sql` with dialect set from selected datasource |
| Table/column autocomplete | Schema fetched from `/datasources/{id}/schema`, passed as `schema` option to `sql()` language extension |
| Keyword autocomplete | Built into `@codemirror/lang-sql` |
| On-demand AI analysis | User-triggered via the **Analyze** button → `POST /queries/analyze`; issues shown as CodeMirror gutter markers and in the AI Hint Panel. Editing the SQL clears the previous result so the analysis cannot become stale. |
| Query formatter | `sql-formatter` library called on `Ctrl+Shift+F` keyboard binding |
| Read-only mode | `EditorState.readOnly` extension set to `true` for detail/history views |
| Theme | Custom theme matching Ant Design token colors; dark/light follows OS preference |
| Risk indicator | Risk score badge in toolbar updates live as AI analysis returns |

### AiHintPanel

Displayed below or beside the editor. Shows:

- Overall `risk_level` badge (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL)
- `risk_score` progress bar
- List of issues, each with severity icon, message, and expandable suggestion
- "Analyzing…" skeleton state while request is in flight
- Empty state if SQL is blank or analysis returns no issues

---

## Theming

- All colour comes from CSS custom properties defined in `src/styles/tokens.css` (light + dark blocks) and mirrored on the Ant Design side in `src/theme/antdTheme.ts`. The two are intentionally duplicated and must be kept in sync.
- Both themes carry WCAG AA contrast on the `--fg-*` text tiers (`--fg`, `--fg-muted`, `--fg-subtle`, `--fg-faint`) against `--bg`. Components must read text colour via these tokens — never hardcode hex.
- The `<Avatar />` component picks its OKLCH lightness from `--avatar-bg-l` / `--avatar-fg-l` so initials remain legible in dark mode against the hue-rotated background. When introducing similar dynamic-colour components, follow the same token-layered pattern rather than branching on `theme` at runtime.
- Status / risk colours go through `src/utils/statusColors.ts` and `src/utils/riskColors.ts` — single source of truth, already covered by tests.
- Dark mode follows `prefers-color-scheme`; user preference lives in `preferencesStore` (Zustand), not `localStorage` directly.

## State Management

### authStore (Zustand)

```typescript
interface AuthStore {
  user: User | null;
  accessToken: string | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  refreshToken: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### WebSocket Hook

The connection itself is owned by `<RealtimeBridge />`, mounted inside `AppLayout` so it only runs under `AuthGuard` — the WebSocket module is never imported by the `/login` or `/setup` routes, and no connection is attempted before authentication. It reads `accessToken` from `authStore`, opens `${VITE_WS_URL}?token=<JWT>` on auth, reconnects with exponential backoff, and disconnects on logout (when `AppLayout` unmounts). The bridge also wires **default `queryClient.invalidateQueries`** for the standard event/key mapping (see table below) — most callers don't need to subscribe at all; they just observe their existing TanStack queries refetching.

Detail and list views (`QueryDetailPage`, `ReviewQueuePage`, etc.) **do not poll** — they rely on these WS-driven invalidations, with the manager's exponential backoff covering transient disconnects. A reload restores state if the WS is permanently unreachable.

For event-specific side effects (e.g. a toast on a new review request), subscribe inside a component:

```typescript
// useWebSocket.ts — typed subscribe wired to the singleton manager
const { subscribe } = useWebSocket();

useEffect(() =>
  subscribe('review.new_request', (data) => {
    message.info(t('realtime.new_review_request', { id: data.query_id }));
  }),
  [subscribe, message, t],
);
```

`subscribe` returns an unsubscribe function — return it from `useEffect` so the listener is removed on unmount.

#### Default invalidations

| Event                  | Invalidates                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query.status_changed` | `['queries','detail',query_id]` and `['queries','list']`                    |
| `query.executed`       | `['queries','detail',query_id]` and `['queries','list']`                    |
| `ai.analysis_complete` | `['queries','detail',query_id]`                                             |
| `review.new_request`   | `['reviews','pending']`                                                     |
| `review.decision_made` | `['reviews','pending']` and `['queries','detail',query_id]`                 |
| `notification.created` | `['notifications','list']` and `['notifications','unread-count']`           |

#### Reconnection

`websocketManager` (in `src/realtime/`) reconnects with exponential backoff `1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 30s` (capped). The counter resets on a successful `onopen`. After 3 consecutive failures the log level drops to `debug` so a sustained backend outage does not spam the console. `disconnect()` clears any pending reconnect timer; re-mounting (`accessToken` becomes non-null) reopens immediately.

The Axios refresh interceptor calls `useAuthStore.setState(...)` whenever the access token rotates — the bridge's `useEffect` reacts to that change and reconnects with the new token. No extra plumbing required.

## Environment Variables

Two values drive the frontend: the REST base URL and the WebSocket URL. They are read through a
single module — `src/config/runtimeConfig.ts` — which exposes `getApiBaseUrl()` and `getWsUrl()`.
Resolution precedence:

1. **`window.__APP_CONFIG__`** — set synchronously by `public/runtime-config.js`, loaded from
   `index.html` *before* the React bundle. This is the production override path: replace one
   file in the served static root (Docker bind-mount, Kubernetes ConfigMap, `sed` in an
   entrypoint) to retarget the same image at a different backend without rebuilding.
2. **`import.meta.env.VITE_*`** — read by Vite at build time. Use for `npm run dev` only; the
   values are baked into the production bundle and cannot be changed at container runtime.
3. **Localhost defaults** — `http://localhost:8080` and `ws://localhost:8080/ws`.

Build-time `.env` (for `npm run dev`):

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

Runtime override (`public/runtime-config.js`, shipped at
`/usr/share/nginx/html/runtime-config.js` in the image):

```js
window.__APP_CONFIG__ = {
  apiBaseUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  wsUrl: "wss://api.example.com/ws",
};
```

Never read `import.meta.env.VITE_*` directly from components — always go through
`getApiBaseUrl()` / `getWsUrl()` so the precedence stays consistent. See
[docs/09-deployment.md → "Frontend Runtime Configuration"](09-deployment.md#frontend-runtime-configuration)
for deployment recipes (Docker Compose, Helm).

## Routing Structure

```
/setup                              → SetupPage (2-step wizard: org+admin, then optional system SMTP)
/login                              → LoginPage (also renders the TOTP verification stage)
/invite/:token                      → AcceptInvitePage (public; previews + accepts a user invitation)
/forgot-password                    → ForgotPasswordPage (public; request a password-reset email)
/reset-password/:token              → ResetPasswordPage (public; previews + consumes a password-reset token)
/auth/saml/callback                 → SamlCallbackPage

/editor                             → QueryEditorPage
/queries                            → QueryListPage  (header **Export CSV** button hits `GET /queries/export.csv` with the active server-side filters — `status`, `datasource_id`, `submitted_by`, `from`, `to`, `query_type`. Client-only filters on the page, namely the free-text search and risk-level select, are not sent because the backend has no equivalent filter; this matches the behaviour of the list endpoint itself. The mutation downloads via a temporary `<a>` element and shows a warning toast when the response carries `X-AccessFlow-Export-Truncated: true`.)
/queries/:id                        → QueryDetailPage
/reviews                            → ReviewQueuePage
/profile                            → ProfilePage

/datasources                        → DatasourceListPage
/datasources/new                    → DatasourceCreateWizardPage
/datasources/:id/settings           → DatasourceSettingsPage

/admin/users                        → UsersPage
/admin/audit-log                    → AuditLogPage
/admin/ai-configs                   → AiConfigListPage
/admin/ai-configs/new               → AiConfigCreateWizardPage (3-step wizard)
/admin/ai-configs/:id               → AiConfigEditPage
/admin/notifications                → NotificationsPage
/admin/languages                    → LanguagesConfigPage
/admin/drivers                      → CustomDriversPage (admin-uploaded JDBC drivers)
/admin/saml                         → SamlConfigPage
/admin/oauth2                       → OAuth2ConfigPage (lazy)
/auth/oauth/callback                → OAuthCallbackPage (lazy, unauthenticated)
```

All routes except `/login`, `/setup`, `/invite/:token`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password/:token`, `/auth/saml/callback`, and `/auth/oauth/callback` are protected by an `AuthGuard` component that redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. Admin routes additionally check `user.role === 'ADMIN'`; `/profile` is available to every authenticated user.

### Setup wizard

`SetupPage` is a two-step state machine. Step 1 collects org name + admin email/password and submits `POST /auth/setup`; the response now returns a `LoginResponse` and sets the refresh cookie so the SPA can call admin endpoints as the freshly-created admin. Step 2 is optional system-SMTP configuration that posts to `PUT /admin/system-smtp` — the **Skip for now** button bypasses it and lands on `/queries`. Users can configure or change SMTP later from `/admin/notifications` (the **System SMTP** card sits above the channels grid).

### User invitations on `/admin/users`

The primary action button is now a `Dropdown.Button` — the default click sends an email invitation (`POST /admin/users/invitations`), while the dropdown menu still exposes the legacy "Create with password" path (`POST /admin/users`). A **Pending invitations** table below the user list shows invitations and exposes per-row resend / revoke actions (`POST /admin/users/invitations/{id}/resend`, `DELETE /admin/users/invitations/{id}`).

### OAuth 2.0 sign-in

`LoginPage` renders one "Continue with &lt;Provider&gt;" button per active row returned by
`GET /api/v1/auth/oauth2/providers` (a public endpoint, queried via TanStack Query with a
short 30 s `staleTime`). Click → `window.location.assign(${API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/auth/oauth2/authorize/<provider>)`
so Spring Security can take over the redirect dance.

`OAuthCallbackPage` parses `?code=...` or `?error=...` from the URL, calls
`exchangeOAuth2Code(code)` to swap the one-time code for a `LoginPayload`, hands it to
`useAuthStore.setSession`, and navigates to `/editor`. On `?error=...` it shows a localised
message (keys under `auth.oauth_callback.error.*`) plus a "Back to sign in" button.

`OAuth2ConfigPage` (`/admin/oauth2`) is admin-only. It renders one Ant `Tabs` per supported
provider (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, GitLab). Each tab is a `Form` with `client_id`,
`client_secret` (masked passthrough — leave `********` to keep the existing secret),
`scopes_override`, `tenant_id` (Microsoft only), `default_role`, and an `active` toggle.
Saving invalidates `oauth2ConfigKeys.all`. Deleting clears the row and the cache so the
button disappears from `/login` after the page is refreshed.

### Profile page and 2FA

`/profile` is composed of three Ant Design cards in `src/pages/profile/`:

- `DisplayNameForm` — Ant `Form` with a single input bound to `useMutation(updateProfile)`. On success it invalidates `meKeys.current` and patches `authStore.user.display_name` so the top-bar reflects the new name immediately.
- `ChangePasswordForm` — current / new / confirm fields (`min: 8, max: 128`). Hidden when `profile.auth_provider === 'SAML'`. On success the backend revokes all refresh tokens; the frontend explicitly calls `authStore.clear()` and navigates to `/login` so the user can re-authenticate cleanly.
- `TwoFactorSection` — branches on `profile.totp_enabled`. Enabled state shows a "Disable 2FA" button that opens `TotpDisableDialog` (password challenge). Disabled state opens `TotpEnrollmentDialog`, a 3-step `Steps` modal: (1) render the backend-supplied `qr_data_uri` in an `<img>` plus the raw secret for manual entry, (2) collect a 6-digit code and `POST /me/totp/confirm`, (3) display the 10 backup recovery codes with copy-to-clipboard and an explicit "I've saved these" acknowledgement before closing. SAML accounts see an info alert instead.

### Two-stage TOTP login

`LoginPage` is a single component with a `stage: 'CREDENTIALS' | 'TOTP'` flag.

1. The user submits email and password. The frontend calls `authStore.login(email, password)`.
2. If the backend returns `401 { error: 'TOTP_REQUIRED' }` the form switches to the TOTP stage (email and password stay in component state, never persisted) and renders a single 6-digit input.
3. On second submit, `authStore.login(email, password, totpCode)` re-posts to `/auth/login`. `TOTP_INVALID` keeps the form on the TOTP stage with an inline error; success navigates to `/editor` as usual. A "Back to sign-in" link returns to stage 1.

The Axios response interceptor in `api/client.ts` skips the auto-refresh path for `/auth/*` URLs so the `TOTP_REQUIRED` 401 reaches the LoginPage component without being absorbed.

The Topbar replaces the standalone logout button with an Ant `Dropdown` whose menu items are **Profile settings** (`/profile`) and **Sign out**. On narrow viewports the display-name pill collapses to the icon via `topbar.css`.
